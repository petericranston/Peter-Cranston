        <p class="about-me">My name is Peter Cranston, I am a undergraduate at Bath Spa University. I study Creative Computing on the web path and am currently in my second year.
            I am most interested in working in C++ as well as web development. I am currently completing a Udemy course on web development to improve on my current abilities 
            and expand my knowledge. I have previously worked as a lifeguard for two years, and stopped to go to university.
